    <p>Maqlubah is a traditional Middle Eastern dish that translates to "upside-down." It typically consists of rice,
        meat, and vegetables cooked together and then flipped upside down before serving.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For Meat & Broth</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Potato</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large potatoes or 4 small potatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Onions and Peppers</h3>

        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>1 large bell pepper (red or orange, not green)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Rice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2.5 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>5.5 cups total liquid (combination of meat broth and water)</li>
        <li>1 tomato</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Garnish (optional)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup slivered or blanched almonds, or pine nuts</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450&#176;F (232&#176;C).</li>
        <li>Wash the eggplant and peel it in alternating stripes as shown in the ingredients photo. Cut into thick
            slices, about half an inch thick.</li>
        <li>Wash and peel the potatoes, then cut them into roughly half-inch thick circles.</li>
        <li>Place the eggplant and potato slices on a lined baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and toss with the oil (see
            ingredient amounts). Bake for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Wash the meat and sear it on medium-high heat using 2 tablespoons of oil.</li>
        <li>Add 3 cups of water and all the whole spices to the meat. Pressure cook for 10 minutes. If not using a
            pressure cooker, boil on the stovetop, covered, on medium heat for 40–60 minutes until tender.</li>
        <li>Cut the onion and pepper into wedges or slices. Cook them with the oil in a pan over medium heat for 7
            minutes until softened. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is cooked, remove it and set aside. Strain the stock to remove the whole spices.</li>
        <li>To the hot stock (in a bowl or pot), add turmeric, salt, black pepper, and tomato paste. Mix well to
            combine. Add additional water to reach 5.5 cups total liquid. Use a measuring cup to measure the stock, then
            top up with water as needed.</li>
        <li>Wash the rice several times until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut the tomato into slices.</li>
        <li>To layer the maqluba, add 2 tablespoons of oil to the bottom of the pot. Layer the tomato slices, followed
            by eggplant, potato, meat, onions and peppers, and finally the rice.</li>
        <li>Pat the rice down firmly, then pour the stock on top. Pat down again using a wooden spoon to ensure the
            stock fully covers the rice.</li>
        <li>Place the pot on medium-high heat and allow it to start bubbling, which should take about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once bubbling, cover the pot and decrease the heat to low. Ensure the pot is well covered, adding a towel on
            top if your lid has holes. Cook for 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 50 minutes, turn off the heat and let the maqluba rest for 5–10 minutes. If the top layer of rice is
            undercooked or under-seasoned, see the troubleshooting section.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, place a large tray with raised edges on top of the pot. Use both hands to hold the
            handles and, in a swift motion, flip the pot over (ask someone to help if needed). Leave the pot inverted
            over the tray for a few minutes to let gravity release the maqluba.</li>
        <li>Lift the pot very slowly to help keep the maqluba intact. Serve with yogurt or Jajik and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You can substitute chicken for the lamb or veal. Use the amount you like, but 600g at a minimum to get a
            good tasting stock.</li>
        <li>You can cook the meat in a pressure cooker or instant pot for faster results. But if you don't have one,
            cook it on the stove top for 40-60 minutes until tender (or less for chicken).</li>
        <li>For the vegetables, you can increase the amounts listed if you prefer more (it will not impact the rice and
            liquid ratio, so leave those the same).</li>
        <li>Use a non stick pot with straight sides for best results.</li>
        <li>If you're using short grain rice, there is a higher risk it will stick together and mush, therefore be sure
            to adjust the water ratio accordingly.</li>
        <li>This recipe yields 6 generous adult servings. But it will depend on how much your household eats. You can
            halve or double the recipe by clicking numbers at the top right of the recipe card.</li>
